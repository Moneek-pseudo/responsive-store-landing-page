Here’s a short, beginner-friendly note on my design choices:

- I kept the layout simple (header, hero, collections, footer) so it’s easy to follow.

- I used Bootstrap’s grid and Tailwind classes together to make sure everything stacks nicely on phones and spreads out on bigger screens.

- I chose a light background with dark text and buttons so it’s readable and the collections pop.

- I added a hover border and lift on product cards to give a little interactive feel.

- The header is sticky so the menu stays visible when you scroll—super handy!

- I used media queries and built-in responsive utilities to shrink text and rearrange nav links on small screens.

- This helped me learn how to mix CSS and Bootstrap to build a page that looks good everywhere.
